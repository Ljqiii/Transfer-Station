### social and political events

##### Spring festival

One social event that is celebrated in my country is the spring festival, or the Chinese new year. It is the biggest festival through out the year. On that day, no matter where they are, families always get together and enjoy a big meal together. They always eat dumplings, a kind of traditional food in Chinese culture. We also watch some fireworks show at the new year's eye. Sometimes children even like to set off fireworks themselves during the spring festival. Chinese people believe that the loud noise of the fireworks can scare the devils away and bring them good luck in the next year. Kids will usually receive some gifts and money from their parents and grandparents, so for them, this is probably their time of the year.

### about study

##### Eight-year-olds are not mature enough to vote

time: 18 years: no real life experience and spend most their times on campus

money: not tax payer and don't shoulder responsibility

influence on yourself: don't care about political issues

influence on others: vote recklessly which may harm the well-being of people

I totally support this statement. First of all, 18-year-olds don't care about what's going on in the world. You know, they don't even read news. It's very likely for them to vote recklessly. Just like me, when I graduated from my high school, what I was thinking about every day was the latest teen serials, or my favorite pop idols, nothing related to political issues. I don't think I was able to make rational decisions when voting at that time. Plus, having no real life experience. So, that's why I don't back up this.

  

##### Some people like having a wide variety of friends and acquaintances they can spend time with. Others like to spend most of their free time with the same small group of close friends.

wide variety of friends:

  hang out with different friends 

  more exciting

  different stories different knowledge

  there will always be someone available 

  not lonely

Personally, I would like to have a wide variety of friends and acquaintances. First of all, it can be more exciting. Every time I go out with my friends, I can hang out with different people. Then I can hear different stories in their daily life, or maybe learn a lot of new knowledge from people doing different kinds of jobs. It's gonna be more fun that way. Also, it's gonna be less likely for me to feel lonely. Cuz if I have lots of friends, there'll always be someone who's available if I ever need someone to be with me. Or if I get into trouble, like if my car breaks down and I need someone to give a ride, I'll always be able to find someone easily.



small group of friends

  hang out with then spend more time

  have a closer relationship

  need help, always available

  hard to maintain too many friendships

  feel tired

Personally, I would like to spend time with the same small group of friends. First of all, we will have a closer relationship that way. That is because, if I only have a few friends to hang out with, we are gonna spend more time together doing a lot of things, such as playing soccer, playing video games or hanging out in clubs. In that way, if I ever need help with anything. I know I can always count on them. Also, I don't enjoy having too many friends. Maintaining too many friendships at the same time is not realistic and it's gonna make me feel tired. So that's why I would like to keep a small circle of friends.

##### the choice of a school or work assignment, would you prefer to write a long report or give a speech in front of a group of people

write a long report

1. require in-depth research 

   literature reference/ statistics

2. develop academic writing skills

3. huge efforts invested in research

4. take too much time

give a speech

1. improve public speaking skill

   benefit future career

2. give more people access to your academic achievement

3. be challenging to speak in front of the public

4. contain limited information

I prefer to give a speech in front of a group of people.

Public speaking is no doubt challenging for a lot of people due to their stage fright, but for me, it's a great chance to show my academic achievements. In the past, the assignments were only available for me and my professor. But a speech enables others to see it as well, hence the opportunities for us to exchange our idea and perspectives afterwards.

Secondly, as well as I enjoy public speaking, there's still a large room for me to improve my skills. Like how to draw audience's attention without boring them, how to deliver message in an effective way, and even how to make a strong ending... I believe this will also benefit my future career.

##### 学习相关 suggest: Why do you think this advice will be helpful the child

1. 学习最重要
2. 学业繁忙

I would just suggest the kid finish all the homework before watching TV or playing.

Otherwise, s/he might end up sleeping late. I learned it the hard way. 

details: what/ when/ who/ where/ how much, how many/ why/ feelings

When I first started school, I was still used to watching TV all the time. Everyday after class, I would spend at least 2-3 hours watching my favorite show first. Because I wanted to relax after a whole day's study.

But the sad thing was that even when you just started school, you would still have a bunch of homework and so I had to stay up late to do it.

##### Students have to complete various types of academic assignments in school

1. research paper

   improve research skills, such as collecting and choosing data, analyzing data, etc. this helps in the future if you want to apply for grad school.

2. class presentation

   improve public speaking skills, which is necessary in the future, no matter what job you do. Practice making PowerPoints, how to design and organize your materials, etc.      

3. group projects

   improve communicative skills; make friends; improve leadership skills, etc.

Group project is surely the best among all three. First of all, students can improve their communicative skills by doing group project. It usually takes four to five people at least to do it, and it's highly likely that everyone has different class schedule. Thus, it is important to know how to negotiate with one another to find a suitable time to everyone. For example, if all of them are busy during the week days, then they can only meet on weekends. This ability is going to have great use for students in the long run. Secondly, with more people doing one job, students will have a poor of diverse ideas, and making it faster for them to complete the task, as well as more effectively. Each one of the team can contribute from different angles, and they can choose the best one. They might even find an interesting perspective that other groups haven't thought about.

##### explain what students should do in order to improve their performance in a class

1. record lectures

   watch the videos when studying

   for exams

2. join a study group

   when encountering difficult questions, you can just ask other group members

3. get help from older students

   older students have taken the class before

4. hire a private tutor

   ask an questions as you want

Personally, I think there are a couple of things that students can do to improve their grades.

Frist of all, they can record lecture. I mean, with the permission of the professor, the students can use their phones to film the lectures. In this way, they can watch the videos when they are studying for exams and they will get better grades.

Also, I think they can join a study group. You know, if they join a study group and encounter difficult questions, they can just ask other group members or have discussions with them. In this way, they get answers easily because others might just have them.

Therefore, these are the things that students can do to improve their grades.

##### students benefit more from classes with a large number of students than they do from smaller classes.

1. large classes

   for students 

   expand social connections

   exchange different perspectives

   for teacher

   get better prepared for the lecture

   more energetic and excited while teaching

2. small class

   for students

   keep a closer bond with each other

   more chance to express themselves/ to interact with teacher

   for teachers

   easy to manage the class

   easy to organize group activities


1. Well, I couldn't agree with this anymore. For starters, with more students in the class, everyone gets to know more people who will become our social connections. Who knows, maybe we can turn to each other for help when facing problems on our study. Plus, exchanging different perspectives definitely helps us think outside the box. In addition, this's also good news for teachers, because they'll get more excited and energetic when facing a full house. At the same time, they'll take it more seriously and get well-prepared for the lecture.
2. Well, I totally disagree with the policy. To begin with, smaller classes means closer bond among students and more interactions with professors. As a college students who studies in a class with over 100 students, I just don't have the chance or the gut to make the move to get acquainted with the guys sitting next to me. Also, in these classes, I hardly get the chance to speak up because the professor keeps lecturing all the time. What's more, I bet professors also prefer smaller classes since it's much easier to remember the names of students. Just imagine how embarrassing it is to call the wrong name in front of the whole class.

### TPO50

Talk about a social or political event that is celebrated in your country. Describe the event and explain how people in your country celebrate it. Use details and examples in your explanation.

##### ex

mid autumn festival: mooncakes, families get together and have dinner

spring festival: dumplings, set off fireworks, families get together and have dinner



### TPO49

Some teachers think that it is important for students to sit in assigned seats, that is, to sit in the same place every day in class. Other teachers think that students should be allowed to choose where they will sit, and they allow them to sit in different seats on different days. Which do you think is better? Explain why.. 

##### ex

assigned seats:

easer for teacher to remember and manage

easier to make close friends, better for group work

##### TPO51

In the lecture, the professor talks about 2 ways that animals may use to maintain group unity. The first one is using threatening display behaviors which mean animals communicate a warning without harming each other. For example, two Baboons find some fruit that they both want. if one first sees it, it will stare at it, making threatening noises. Then, the other Baboon can give up the fruit because it knows the meaning of the stares and noises. As a result, the conflict is prevented. Another way is friendly display behaviors which is used to reconcile after physical fights. Again, say the two Baboons, they do end up having a physical fight over the fruit. Afterwards, they would approach each other while making friendly noises or even huge each other. In this way, the Baboons can make up and group unity is maintained.



##### TPO50

The professor talks about two different kinds of adaptations. The first kind is a defensive one, which means using strong body features to make it hard for predators to get to them. For example, the turtle has  a very strong shell that covers its bake and vital organs. Its neck and legs are all flexible so they can go under the shell. The shell itself is very hard and it won't break or split open, so the predators cannot get the turtle.

The other kind of protective adaptions is an offensive one. Animals with offensive protective adaptations have body structures to keep the predators away. For example, porcupines have needle-like quills. When the predators attack the porcupines, the quills will come off and be embedded in the predators' skin. So the predators will stay away from them.

##### TPO39

The first feature is the strong muscles that help animals to climb up and down the steep slopes.

For example, mountain goats which live in mountains in North America have strong muscles on their chest and front legs. These muscles enable them to pull themselves up as they walk on the steep slopes and balance well when they climb down. In this process, great strength and balance are needed.

The second one is the feet adapted to keep them from slipping on ice and rocks. Safe and sure footing allow animals to walks on the mountains even when there is ice and snow.

Take bighorn sheep as an example, their toes can move independently so that each one of them can dig into the rock and ice. And the round rubbery pads also help them grip the surface of the ground, so they are less likely to fall down.
